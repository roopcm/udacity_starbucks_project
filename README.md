## The Dataset Used for the work
* The program used to create the data simulates how people make purchasing decisions and how those decisions are influenced by promotional offers.
* Each person in the simulation has some hidden traits that influence their purchasing patterns and are associated with their observable traits. People produce various events, including receiving offers, opening offers, and making purchases.
* As a simplification, there are no explicit products to track. Only the amounts of each transaction or offer are recorded.
* There are three types of offers that can be sent: buy-one-get-one (BOGO), discount, and informational. In a BOGO offer, a user needs to spend a certain amount to get a reward equal to that threshold amount. In a discount, a user gains a reward equal to a fraction of the amount spent. In an informational offer, there is no reward, but neither is there a requisite amount that the user is expected to spend. Offers can be delivered via multiple channels.
* The basic task is to use the data to identify which groups of people are most responsive to each type of offer, and how best to present each type of offer.
